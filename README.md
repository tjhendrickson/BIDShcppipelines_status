## BIDS-apps HCPPipeline Processing Status

This repository was designed in order to determine the processing status of the HCPPipeline processing stream steps (i.e. PreFreeSurfer, FreeSurfer, PostFreeSurfer, fMRIVolume, fMRISurface, ICAFIX, PostFix, RestingStateStats, TaskfMRIAnalysis, and Diffusion). 

### Description
The HCP Pipelines product is a set of tools (primarily, but not exclusively,
shell scripts) for processing MRI images for the [Human Connectome Project](https://www.humanconnectome.org/).
Among other things, these tools implement the Minimal Preprocessing Pipeline
(MPP) described in [Glasser et al. 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23668970).
